# Opinion piece

## Makes sense

- `chan`
- Global declaration space
- Type compatibility implies object composition

## Kind-of makes sense

- Pointers
- Package and directory system

## Makes no sense

- Case-sensitivity
- Using `&Class{args}` to initialize a new instance of `Class`
- Method overloading not supported
- Declare dependent packages directly by repository location
